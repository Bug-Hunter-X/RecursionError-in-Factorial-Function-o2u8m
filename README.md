# Python RecursionError Example

This repository demonstrates a common error in Python involving recursion: the `RecursionError`. The `factorial_bug.py` file shows a factorial function that does not handle negative input correctly, leading to infinite recursion.  The solution, shown in `factorial_solution.py`, demonstrates how to avoid this by adding a check for negative input.
